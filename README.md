# madison-2025-budget-sim
A notebook to look at the City of Madison projected budgets.

Used in support of my blog post series on the future of Madison budgets. 
This mostly corresponds to the second post in the series

[Madison`s Budget Challenges: A Four Part Series](https://posts.unit1127.com/p/madisons-budget-challenges-a-four)

The AgencyBudgets.xlsx Excel sheet is the input data and is mostly taken copied out the City's budget documents. See the blog post or notebooks for details.

The two CSV files are the outputs of the simulation. 
To make them a little easier to read, I copied them into an Excel workbook and put some formatting on them, but the data should be the same.

To run the notebook, you just need numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and tqdm.
